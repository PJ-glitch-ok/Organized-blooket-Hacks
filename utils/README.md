**RemoveGlizCredit.js**



**Removes the box that apears when you run any of gliz's scripts**

**Just to be 100% clear the RemoveGlizCredit script dosent accually remove his credits. It just removes the box that pops up when you use his hacks. Because Its really annoying.**


**MakeSiteDraggable.js**



**Just makes the site draggable (i will most likely remove this)**
